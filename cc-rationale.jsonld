    "comment": "I have decided to vote YES in favour of replacing the Interim Constitution with the delegate-endorsed Cardano Constitution. However, I do so after much deliberation and with some reservations regarding the processes by which we have arrived here and considering the future.\n\nFirstly, I would like to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of all Delegates, Alternates and Constitutional workshop attendees who have passionately fought to have their voices, and those of whom they represented, heard in this Constitution. Often in the face of some serious “shepherding” of the conversations.\n\nSecondly, a thank you to community-built tools such as cgov.app by MadOrkestra who worked up to the eleventh hour in order to ensure that community members could be heard when they may have not been able to attend in-person events. The passion of the Cardano Community is one of its’ greatest strengths and will be a decisive factor in the success or failure of this ecosystem.\n\nThe delegate-endorsed Constitution is an improvement on the currently implemented Interim Constitution, both in terms of content and validity, given that no community-wide vote was held regarding the initial implementation of the Interim Constitution.\n\nGiven that the passing of this Constitution also opens the door to the potential ratification of future New Constitution, Update Constitutional Committee and Motion of No Confidence governance actions as per Interim Constitution Guardrail INTERIM-04, the current distribution of DRep delegation should be considered.\n\nI feel that greater education efforts are required here. Simply telling ADA holders to “pick a DRep or Auto-Abstain” in order to withdraw their rewards without educating them on the impact of “Auto-Abstain” on the voting process has thus far been somewhat irresponsible. We now have almost 70% of all voting-registered stake addresses accounting for 50% of all DRep-delegated stake not participating in governance thanks to this current approach. At this moment in time, a minimum of 26 DReps could reach a 67% threshold and the fact that one of those DReps currently has a 12% thumb on the scale is a cause for concern. Thankfully, the tricameral model of Cardano governance means that SPOs should be able to mitigate any potential issues from outsized bad actors attempting to take advantage of the current levels of distribution."
