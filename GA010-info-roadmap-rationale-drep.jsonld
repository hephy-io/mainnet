    "comment": "While I am grateful for the efforts that have gone into the creation of this roadmap and largely agree with the content of the proposal submitted on-chain for DRep consideration, understanding the importance of setting a clear direction for the future of the Cardano blockchain ecosystem, I have some reservations around the implementation/use of the Info Action in this instance.\n\nFirstly, the proposed roadmap linked in the on-chain proposal is not an immutable source. (https://product.cardano.intersectmbo.org/vision-roadmap-2025) While attempts have been made to remedy this concern, post-submission, by hosting a “static” version of the initial proposal (https://product.cardano.intersectmbo.org/vision-roadmap-2025-static) it still raises the issue of the immutability of governance proposals. The proposal and linked content both acknowledge that the proposed roadmap will evolve over time, for example, the linked roadmap states, “The vision and roadmap represents a high-level overview and will be further refined and iterated upon based on ongoing research, community feedback, and technological advancements. It is based on the results of the TSC survey.” With this in mind, I feel that it would have been helpful to at least provide a link to an immutable copy of the original intent, for reference in the future and to provide some level of accountability throughout the proposed development process.\n\nI appreciate the irony that this rationale is hosted on Github and not IPFS but my vote decision will be permanent on the blockchain regardless of this rationale. It is different to a proposal that is actively being voted on, where the very content may evolve away from what was initially voted on.\n\nSecondly, the submitted governance action also states, “While the referenced roadmap develops, Dreps should consider submitting multiple votes to signal approval across versions” but does not outline how this proposed revision process would work. Who will be expected to raise these future Info Actions for voting on these potential changes and how often is the roadmap expected to be reviewed using this particular feedback channel during its lifespan?\n\nSplit between my general support for the proposed roadmap content and the conflicting thoughts regarding the use of the Info Action in this instance, with its mutable references, I have decided to vote abstain at this time."
