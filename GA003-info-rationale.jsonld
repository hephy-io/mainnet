    "comment": "While this vote is in support of the question raised in the Info Action it is important to provide further context and education on the subject. The Info Action refers to the K-parameter and while this has been a long-disputed topic amongst the Cardano community, namely SPOs and similarly technically minded individuals, it has also been something of a relative mystery to the everyday ADA holder. Secondly, this parameter is now known as stakePoolTargetNum, as found in Appendix I: Section 2.4 of the Interim Constitution which pertains to Technical/Security Parameters. Arguably, this is a much more accessible and identifiable name for the everyday user to understand also.\n\n The parameter in question determines the ideal number of stake pools when the system is in equilibrium. As a result, it also determines the saturation point (or size) of a stake pool. This is calculated by dividing the current circulating supply of ADA by the stakePoolTargetNum (formerly K) value.\n\n When the parameter was increased to 500 on 6 December  2020, the pool size limit was c.64M ADA. Following the increase in the circulating supply in the years since then, the pool size limit today is c.74M ADA. This has meant that a multi-pool operator of 5 or more pools has, in effect, almost gained the potential to amass the delegation of a whole extra pool at December 2020 levels without having to deploy any extra infrastructure.\n\n While this vote supports another look into increasing the parameter value, I do not think that that it should be as drastic as the 1000 often put forward by many.\n\n Example stakePoolTargetNum values and their corresponding pool size limits:\n\n 500 = 74,708,463 (current)\n 588 = 63,538,362\n 750 = 49,805,642\n 1000 = 37,354,231\n\n A subtle stakePoolTargetNum (formerly K) increase to 588 would reset pool size limits to December 2020 levels and would be a more sustainable change so as to minimize the impact on the slow to move stake delegation that has become apparent in the years since Proof-of-Stake went live on the Cardano mainnet. Higher values could lead to problems like pool splitting which could increase infrastructure costs, over-saturation of single pools due to slow redelegation of stake and a reduction in rewards across the board."
