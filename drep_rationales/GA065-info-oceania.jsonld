    "comment": "I am voting YES on the budget info action proposal for the Cardano in Oceania 2025-2026 strategy and budget. The proposal seeks funding for greater co-ordination of Cardano outreach efforts across the Oceania region, building upon previous experiences and efforts in the space. I appreciate the provision of a website that outlines the “Why, What, How and Who” in more detail, I particularly like the provision of the git commit used to build the website as it provides a level of immutability and a point of reference for the proposal content and ensures that any future alterations can be checked against the information provided for this proposal.\n\nThe site provided in the supporting links of the proposal (https://cardano-in-oceania.github.io) provides detailed team, supporters and administrator info, along with a detailed budget breakdown, implementation timeline and milestones.\n\nI was fortunate enough to have been able to meet a number of individuals associated with this proposal during the Constitutional Convention, including Jo Allum and Peter Horsfall (Community Leaders), Nathan Barkell, Engie Matene and Corinne Phillips (Supporters & Contributors), as well as Mark Byers from Selfdriven Services (Administrator). In addition to these individuals, the proposal also lists other prominent community educators (Peter Bui) and governance advocates (Phil Lewis), SPOs (46S and ECO), a wallet (Tokeo) and DEX (VyFi) amongst its Sponsors and Partners.\n\nI have had little contact with these individuals since the Constitutional Convention so there is no undue influence here but my experience online and offline is that this proposal has a very accomplished and professional team behind it and reflects the vibrant ecosystem that exists across the Oceania region. It draws on backgrounds such as technical, educational, legal, governance, and financial, and is well-rounded in this regard, putting the initiative in good stead to pursue and achieve its goals.\n\nFor those that say this proposal should go to Catalyst, you simply cannot achieve the goals set out in a proposal such as this with Catalyst funding. The budgets for associated rounds are too small for a co-ordinated effort on this scale and we as an ecosystem need to move beyond this knee-jerk reaction of “try Catalyst” for marketing and outreach. We have already witnessed another community outreach initiative, Discover Cardano, put up significant sums of their own money to represent Cardano at events where there was otherwise no representation, to great success, and still be twice rejected at the Catalyst level. It was only thanks to a big community push on socials that they even passed their recent treasury withdrawal proposal. We as a community often complain that founding entities are not doing enough of this work but when genuine and serious community actors step up to fill a gap we seem equally as hesitant."
