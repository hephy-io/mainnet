    "comment": "I vote “YES” in favour of the proposed 200M ada net change limit (NCL). I do so in accordance with my past reasoning for voting “NO” on the previously passed 350M NCL proposal, believing that amount to be too high at the time and I still do. For example, much of the budget process has been carried out using an ada price of $0.50, a price the market has not seen since November 2024. At the time of this vote, the ada price is $0.77 and has sat in the $0.70-$0.84 range for much of this proposals’ voting period. 350M ada at $0.50 would be $175M while 200M at $0.77 today still accounts for around $154M, therefore I do not consider a potential 200M NCL to be as prohibitive for development spending as it may seem.\n\nMany DReps at the time of the previous proposal for 350M ada stated in their rationales that they were voting in favour of that proposal in the absence of any other alternative and so it has been reassuring to see community members step forward with this proposal. It both demonstrates an example of a well-constructed community proposal and provides a forum whereby DReps are able to have their say on a broader range of net change limit options.\n\nThe proposal is well-written and stored via a more immutable medium, utilising IPFS to host the proposal metadata. At the time of voting, the file remains accessible and the submitted file hash matches with the currently accessible file."
