    "comment": "I vote “YES” in favour of the proposed budget for Amaru Node Development 2025. This is an extremely well composed proposal and from a highly respected team in the Cardano ecosystem. It serves as an excellent example of a governance action proposal. It is well-written, making excellent use of markdown which allows for much better readability on sites like GovTool, and provides excellent transparency by providing numerous links to websites, code repositories and profiles of key contributors, as well as a detailed cost breakdown for the requested amount of 1.5M ada. The proposal also provides a detailed administration and reporting framework to improve transparency and provides accountability measures.\n\nThe need for the development of alternative node options, in addition to the long-standing and successful Haskell node implementation that has served as the backbone of the Cardano ecosystem to date, has gained significant traction in recent months. The importance of which was highlighted by the recent Node Diversity workshop held in Paris alongside Paris Blockchain Week 2025, demonstrating some ecosystem consensus that such development would be a suitable area for some treasury allocation for funding.\n\nFinally, at the time of voting, the proposal metadata is hosted via the more immutable medium of IPFS where the file remains accessible and the hash has been verified as matching that provided at the time of proposal submission."
