I appreciate that the proposers have taken on community feedback, enlisted the help of Intersect, and put forth a Board of Advisors to help administer the use of funds. This is the first time that a treasury withdrawal has been made with an expressed intention to repay the requested funds and as Cardano governance continues to evolve it is encouraging to see proposers experimenting with ways to make both Cardano governance and the treasury more sustainable."
