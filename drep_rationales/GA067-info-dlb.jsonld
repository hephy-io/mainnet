    "comment": "I am choosing to vote ABSTAIN on the Stablecoin DeFi Liquidity Budget info action. I find myself conflicted with regards to this proposal. My heart says yes while my head has its doubts. While I naturally want what is best for the Cardano ecosystem and hope that this proposal delivers as it intends to, I have reservations about the utilisation percentage of the NCL and whether the proposal will actually achieve what it intends to, especially when evaluated in the context of the wider cryptocurrency space.\n\nI have always regarded the Net Change Limit as a spending cap and not a spending target. There is currently 77,968,493 ada remaining and using 64.12% of that (or 14.28% of the total NCL) on what is an as yet an untested experiment feels too much.\n\nOne comment from the Cardano Summit 2024 has stuck with me over the past year and it came from the panel “Does Liquidity Bring Users Or Do Users Bring Liquidity?” no less. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1nw7munfXY).  The comment was made by Senad DIlji and it was that regarding Cardano, “I don’t think it’s really a marketing issue, I think it’s more of a perception issue”. It was absolutely true, while we see our progress and growth within our own ecosystem, there is no denying the fact that the larger crypto space, to date, simply has not cared, largely because Cardano is rarely present where it needs to be. Thankfully recent months have seen moves to correct this with the unified front at Token 2049, the recent Asia tour and Discover Cardano presence at Gitex, Dubai.\n\nTo argue that Cardano isn’t taken seriously because of TVL and liquidity and that this proposal is needed to “first fix it ourselves, in order to attract others” potentially invites critics and naysayers to once again move the ever-moving goalposts and claim that the ecosystem is merely “propped up from within”.\n\nWith regards to many of the actual DeFi mechanics, I also choose to vote abstain in recognition of the fact that my knowledge and experience in this area is not at a level where I feel comfortable making the decision one way or another.\n\nI do however wish the proposal the best of success and sincerely hope that it achieves what it sets out to do. I just cannot in good conscience throw my full weight behind it given my personal doubts and the shortcomings of my own knowledge on the topic."
