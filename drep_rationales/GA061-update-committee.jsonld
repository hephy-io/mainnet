    "comment": "I have my reservations regarding handing 28.57% of voting power to just 2 individuals on this Committee and that DRep participation in this election was shockingly low, with the most voted candidate in this election still only receiving votes from less than 10% of DReps (85 votes out of ~900 Dreps).\n\nHowever, the interim period of Cardano governance was meant to be just that, interim. With the official end of the interim period marked by the ratification of the community-agreed Constitution, the original Interim Constitution mandated that the Interim Constitutional Committee shall serve an inaugural term of 73 epochs from the date of the Chang hard fork (Article IV, Section 2 of the Interim Constitution). This leaves the election of all the seats of the Constitutional Committee to be the last remaining step towards reaching the full on-chain governance as decided by ada holders.\n\nDReps had their chance to vote during the Constitutional Committee elections and if either DReps did not vote or ada holders did not move their delegation to those that best represented their choices in the time available, then that is a matter for them to re-evaluate. There was an election, results were audited and therefore I vote in favour of this update committee action.\n\nAs an outgoing ICC member, acting as one of several community members representing the Intersect Constitutional Council over the past year I would just like to say that it has been an honour to serve in this capacity and an experience as we all began to find our way in this new world of on-chain governance. Knowing the work that went into the role behind the scenes it is with both sadness and relief that I look forward to the new CC. Sadness that the work put in over the past year was not valued enough to earn another spot on the Committee and that thereâ€™s a wealth of experience among prospective Adara members that is now seeking a suitable outlet, but also relief with the knowledge of just how much work the past year has been behind the scenes. I wish the incoming Constitutional Committee all the best in their new / recurring roles."
