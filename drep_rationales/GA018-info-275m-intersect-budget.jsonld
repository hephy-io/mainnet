    "comment": "I vote “YES” in favour of the proposed Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget of 275,269,340 ada that would be administered by Intersect. While I may not agree on the high ada valuation of this budget I am fully aware that we are now in the month of June 2025 and fast approaching a critical window for funding the development and maintenance of the Cardano blockchain and its wider ecosystem. It is also an ada value that leaves some room in the currently active net change limit of 350 million ada for other projects who do not wish to appoint Intersect as their administrator to still be able to propose their own separate budgets.\n\nThe proposal is well constructed and has been informed by numerous off-chain processes, including initial project applications through Intersect, followed by voting on the Ekklesia platform, using live DRep voting stake, in order to narrow down the projects included in this proposed budget.\n\nTreasury withdrawal and fund management processes are outlined in the proposal and also serve as a reminder that, even if this budget is approved, it does not automatically guarantee funding for the projects listed within. Projects will still be subject to due diligence and oversight throughout the budget period. Treasury withdrawal proposals will also have to pass with the consent of DReps and the ICC/CC, passing this budget would allow corresponding treasury withdrawals to be proposed as mandated by the Constitution. It would be a progression in the Cardano governance process and not necessarily a guarantee that the proposed budget limit would be reached or required."
