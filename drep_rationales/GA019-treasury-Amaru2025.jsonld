    "comment": "I vote YES on the treasury withdrawal governance action requesting 1.5 million ada for the Amaru Node Development 2025. This treasury withdrawal proposal is made pursuant to the previously proposed budget info action which passed with over 80% DRep approval by active voting stake (Source: https://adastat.net/governances/bd488931f792651fefa9c6fda185a2c6cec83245b51d994e33090ce36e29cc2600).\n\nAs the first treasury withdrawal governance action it sets a very high bar with its professionalism and thoroughness. The proposal is excellently formatted with links to all of the relevant information including the proposers, the individuals involved, fund management structures and associated stake addresses. Appropriate diagrams help to make the smart contract setup accessible to non-technical voters and the provision of a publicly available journal regarding financial audits reinforces support for non-technical community members even further.\n\nNode diversity remains one of the few areas of decentralisation left for the Cardano ecosystem to overcome and I am happy to see an endeavour such as Amaru be funded. It boasts a highly competent team, whose track record is well known in the Cardano community and has received strong support with the prior budget proposal. While some have raised concerns regarding ecosystem and development fragmentation with multiple nodes, finally having an alternative to the ultra-reliable Haskell node that has served the ecosystem so well to date may also breed competition and innovation from competing clients.\n\nShould this proposal pass, it will also serve as a pivotal milestone as not only the first Cardano treasury withdrawal but also one that is the first development team to be funded by the community that is not a founding entity. This would serve as a great demonstration to the wider crypto community that if you have a serious project with serious intention, that you are welcome here and can get funded by the community.\n\nI have also taken the extra step of checking the on-chain proposal via the command line to ensure that the values stated in the metadata match those requested on-chain.\n\nBest of luck to the team on their alternative node endeavours."
