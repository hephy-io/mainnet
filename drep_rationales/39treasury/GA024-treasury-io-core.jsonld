    "comment": "While I might not agree with bundling such a large scope of work into one proposal of this size, forcing voters to agree to funding some elements that they might feel less necessary or restricting them the opportunity to convey which items they would like to see prioritised I do recognise the critical juncture that we now find ourselves at with regards to continued development of the core protocol and the timing of the market cycle. Therefore, I vote in favour of this proposal at this time as any disruption in delivery or negative headlines would be far more damaging to progress than to attempt to push for a more refined or modular proposal at this time.\n\nAs 1 of 15 proposals in this series of 39 treasury withdrawal governance actions that I had previously voted for during the budget reconciliation process via Ekklesia I vote YES. In keeping with previous voting intentions of keeping total treasury withdrawal expenditure below 250 million ada I have focussed my selections on core development and essential maintenance of community tooling as we enter this critical period of the market cycle. I have tried to balance between large project asks and smaller but still very essential maintenance for existing tooling, with projects that have a proven track record."
