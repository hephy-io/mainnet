    "comment": "Much like wallets, I am hesitant to vote for treasury funds being used to fund explorers when Catalyst may be a better avenue. However, explorers are also one of the first points of call for newcomers and people looking to seek out information about a blockchain and Cexplorer (formerly adapools) has been one of the longest standing in the ecosystem. Significant work appears to have been put in recently towards their 2.0 release and early beta access has shown some impressive improvements, especially in the areas of overall speed of the explorer and of expanded governance features. It is essential for open and participatory governance that ada holders have various useful sources of information in order to inform their decisions. Therefore, I vote in favour of funding this long-standing team with a proven track record.\n\nWhile not originally one of my selections during the Ekklesia budget reconciliation process, I have decided to vote in favour/against funding this proposal at this time."
