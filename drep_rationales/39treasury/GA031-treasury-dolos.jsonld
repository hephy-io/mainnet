    "comment": "The Dolos project appears to be narrower in scope compared to some of the projects seeking funding at the moment. However, it is an open-source project and states that adoption for its specific case is growing. The Cardano ecosystem could use more node diversity within its ecosystem, especially as the chain and its history grows, it may not always be feasible or necessary for certain projects to run the traditional node infrastructure with its associated overheads as we know it. Dolos here seems to offer a lightweight alternative for those with very specific data requirements. I support funding it now with an eye to monitoring its adoption rates in the short to medium term, ahead of any additional future funding requests.\n\nThis is one of a number of treasury withdrawal requests from TxPipe and I respect that they divided their requests into their respective projects rather than bundling them all into one request, allowing ada holders the opportunity to express their views on what areas they would like to see treasury funds committed to.\n\nAs 1 of 15 proposals in this series of 39 treasury withdrawal governance actions that I had previously voted for during the budget reconciliation process via Ekklesia I vote YES. In keeping with previous voting intentions of keeping total treasury withdrawal expenditure below 250 million ada I have focussed my selections on core development and essential maintenance of community tooling as we enter this critical period of the market cycle. I have tried to balance between large project asks and smaller but still very essential maintenance for existing tooling, with projects that have a proven track record."
