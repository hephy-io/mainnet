    "comment": "This proposal was not originally one of my selections during the Ekklesia budget reconciliation process and I have decided to remain against funding this proposal at this time. Using treasury funds for exchange listings in this way could set a dangerous precedent whereby any future CNT looking to be listed on any and all exchanges finds that exchanges, having seen this precedent, then demand the same funding for any CNT listings going forward. The treasury should be used for ecosystem tooling, development and improving the user experience for ada holders, not as a cash cow for exchanges who see a few projects listed via treasury funding and then in turn attempt to make that the new norm in the listing process for the Cardano ecosystem alone due to its particular  treasury and on-chain governance system."
