    "comment": "This was not originally one of my selections during the Ekklesia budget reconciliation process and I have decided to vote in favour of funding this proposal at this time. In-line with my Scalus and OpShin rationales, improving the developer experience on Cardano is important and increasing the number of programming languages available to developers is a good way to achieving this, especially with regards to dispelling the common misconception in the wider crypto community that Cardano is still “Haskell only”. PyCardano has been developed on Cardano for a while now and has some success with adoption to date and I will be interested to see how this treasury funding will help push this adoption amongst the Python community to the next level. As another project that has received Catalyst funding in the past, I will be interested to see the progress as a result of funding this time before approving any further treasury requests in the future."
