    "comment": "Blockfrost has been an integral part to the development of the wider Cardano ecosystem with their API platform. It is encouraging to see their intention to move their platform to a more open-source and decentralised model and their intentions are already visible on-chain with the current progress of their Icebreakers programme. DISCLAIMER: In my capacity as an SPO, HEPHY is currently operating as part of the Icebreaker programme by contributing spare node resources.\n\nAs 1 of 15 proposals in this series of 39 treasury withdrawal governance actions that I had previously voted for during the budget reconciliation process via Ekklesia I vote YES. In keeping with previous voting intentions of keeping total treasury withdrawal expenditure below 250 million ada I have focussed my selections on core development and essential maintenance of community tooling as we enter this critical period of the market cycle. I have tried to balance between large project asks and smaller but still very essential maintenance for existing tooling, with projects that have a proven track record."
