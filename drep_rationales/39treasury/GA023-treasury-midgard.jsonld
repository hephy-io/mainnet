    "comment": "Midgard is a promising development for Cardano and one that offers to showcase development opportunities and scaling technologies that are possible on Cardano and from a community development team rather than longstanding stalwarts Input Output. It could serve as a great demonstration of what is also possible from development teams that havenâ€™t been the core builders over the past several years.  With a goal of EOY mainnet readiness, a reasonable budget request when compared to some currently up for vote and with a team of accomplished developers at Anastasia Labs, well-known in the community, I support this proposal.\n\nAs 1 of 15 proposals in this series of 39 treasury withdrawal governance actions that I had previously voted for during the budget reconciliation process via Ekklesia I vote YES. In keeping with previous voting intentions of keeping total treasury withdrawal expenditure below 250 million ada I have focussed my selections on core development and essential maintenance of community tooling as we enter this critical period of the market cycle. I have tried to balance between large project asks and smaller but still very essential maintenance for existing tooling, with projects that have a proven track record."
