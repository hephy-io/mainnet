However, lidonation.com currently shows 19 outstanding projects under their name that were approved for funding, one such request is for 487,679 ada for “Advancing Plutarch and CTL”. \n\nAt this moment in time, I choose to abstain from using the treasury for further funding until more progress is made on these remaining Catalyst projects. Fund 14 is also imminent which also provides another avenue for this particular project should their treasury withdrawal proposal fail to pass."
