    "comment": "Originally 1 of 15 proposals in this series of 39 treasury withdrawal governance actions that I had previously voted for during the budget reconciliation process via Ekklesia I vote YES. As stated in my Scalus proposal rational, improving the developer experience on Cardano is important and increasing the number of programming languages available to developers is a good way to achieving this, especially with regards to dispelling the common misconception in the wider crypto community that Cardano is still “Haskell only”. The team behind OpShin have been developing on Cardano for a while now and I look forward to seeing how successful they are at attracting Python developers to the ecosystem with their tools. Much like Scalus, I also see that OpShin has received Catalyst funding in the past and will keep this in mind ahead of any further request for treasury funding in the future."
