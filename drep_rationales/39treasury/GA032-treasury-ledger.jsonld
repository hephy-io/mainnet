    "comment": "I support funding for a Ledger app rewrite. Ledger remains one of, if not the most, popular choice for retail users when it comes to hardware wallet security. We have already witnessed some difficulties with manufacturers like Trezor when it comes to merging the latest features even when Cardano-specific teams have done the work for them. It is essential for the safety of hardware wallet user funds and for wider Cardano adoption that the Cardano ecosystem be treated and represented fairly with a fully functional app that conforms to the expected standards for UI and testing.\n\nAs 1 of 15 proposals in this series of 39 treasury withdrawal governance actions that I had previously voted for during the budget reconciliation process via Ekklesia I vote YES. In keeping with previous voting intentions of keeping total treasury withdrawal expenditure below 250 million ada I have focussed my selections on core development and essential maintenance of community tooling as we enter this critical period of the market cycle. I have tried to balance between large project asks and smaller but still very essential maintenance for existing tooling, with projects that have a proven track record."
