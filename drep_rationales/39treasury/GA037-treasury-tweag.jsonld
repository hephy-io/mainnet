    "comment": "As stated during my vote for the IO Core Development proposal, I do not agree with bundling large scopes of work into one proposal of this size, forcing voters to agree to funding some elements that they might feel less necessary or restricting them the opportunity to convey which items they would like to see prioritised. However, TWEAG have an impressive record as developers in this space and have contributed in a big way to the development of Ouroboros Genesis and are one of the biggest development firms with an intimate understanding of core Cardano technology outside of IOG itself. It is important to diversify core development across more teams in addition to simply just IOG, operational resilience and greater mind share are both benefits of such an approach.\n\nThe PDF document put together by TWEAG was of a high standard and provided a detailed breakdown of the perceived problems, proposed solutions and explanation of their considered costs.  Chief concern in my view is the continuation of the work on Ouroboros Peras and as stated in the IO Core Development rationale, interruptions to such key developments right now would be critical. \n\nWhile not originally one of my selections during the Ekklesia budget reconciliation process, I have decided to vote in favour funding this proposal at this time."
