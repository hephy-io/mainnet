    "comment": "I had initial reservations regarding adding another “middle man” into the equation when it comes to funding projects but I have come to see why an initiative such as this might be necessary. Catalyst rounds are too infrequent to be a sustainable source of funding for ongoing open-source work and evolving situations (such as bug bounties) and simply arguing “we have the treasury” now is an impractical expectation of small open-source teams to have to source and submit a 100,000 ada deposit every time they would like to request funding for completed work. The Cardano ecosystem currently lacks an effective system for smaller-scale and nimble funding of open-source work and bug bounty programmes.\n\nWhile not originally one of my selections during the Ekklesia budget reconciliation process, I have decided to vote in favour/against funding this proposal at this time."
