    "comment": "While not originally one of my selections during the Ekklesia budget reconciliation process, I have decided to vote in favour of funding this proposal at this time. Improving the developer experience on Cardano is important and increasing the number of programming languages available to developers is a good way to achieving this, especially with regards to dispelling the common misconception in the wider crypto community that Cardano is still “Haskell only”. \n\nThe team behind this proposal appear to have strong backgrounds with histories of working with IOG and traditional finance companies. I see they have received some funding through Catalyst already and so will be keeping an eye on how this develops with regard to any further treasury funding requests in the future."
