    "comment": "For me, support for the people behind this proposal continues to be one of the most perplexing occurrences in this ecosystem. Reading other rationales I see other DReps saying “Catalyst would be better”, they’ve tried Catalyst… twice! And been discounted both times, after having invested significant sums of their own money to have a Cardano presence at a major industry event in 2023 where otherwise there would have been none. Personally, I do not blame them for now trying the direct treasury route instead.\n\nAdmittedly, it appears that there has been, to a degree, a case of “lost in translation” between the “Discover Cardano” who we may know from social media and the registered entity  “Supplyoneers FZ-LLC” named on this proposal.\n\nThroughout a period where it could be argued that the founding entities dropped the ball somewhat regarding their presence at wider industry events outside of the Cardano Summit and Rare Evo, Discover Cardano was there trying to fill that gap. Identifying funding restrictions that limited project participation they implemented a novel idea to represent projects at their event booth in Dubai in 2023. It has been mildly frustrating seeing founding entities come crawling out of the woodwork offering a global marketing presence now that the treasury has been unlocked while grass-roots efforts like this one continue to get kicked to the curb despite their best efforts.\n\nThey have provided detailed cost breakdowns and a plan of action and revised their proposal based on community feedback but somehow it appears as though it will never be enough. If we’re not careful as a community, we will lose good people like this altogether.\n\nAs 1 of 15 proposals in this series of 39 treasury withdrawal governance actions that I had previously voted for during the budget reconciliation process via Ekklesia I vote YES."
