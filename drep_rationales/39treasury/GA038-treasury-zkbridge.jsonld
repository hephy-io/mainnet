    "comment": "As one of two ZK proposals currently requesting funding from the Cardano treasury I think it is important to have teams exploring a range of scaling solutions for Cardano. While a lot of the zero-knowledge focus has been around Midnight it will be good to see some developments in this area for Cardano itself too. The vendor profile appears to indicate a promising team who already have a growing list of achievements in the zero-knowledge space. It is extra encouraging to note that they have committed to making their technology open-source.\n\nWhile not originally one of my selections during the Ekklesia budget reconciliation process, I have decided to include this item amongst my funding choices at this time."
