    "comment": "AdaStat is possibly my most used Cardano explorer and I am in favour of funding itâ€™s continued development. They are not a project that has excessively applied or been funded by Catalyst in the past but have kept up with the development of their platform and always open to feedback on socials, often quick to respond and add any new features/changes suggested by the community. This funding request for a 24-month period is reasonable ask.\n\nNo one explorer is perfect yet, each offers some features that another might not but AdaStat is arguably one of the most referenced explorers in the age of governance with regards to tracking voting processes and personally I am a fan of their filtering tools when searching for stake pools (especially Mithril supporting pools). Loading speeds on the explorer are good and explorers are often one of the first point of contact for newcomers investigating a chain and so first impressions are everything, I support funding the future maintenance and development of this platform.\n\nAs 1 of 15 proposals in this series of 39 treasury withdrawal governance actions that I had previously voted for during the budget reconciliation process via Ekklesia I vote YES. In keeping with previous voting intentions of keeping total treasury withdrawal expenditure below 250 million ada I have focussed my selections on core development and essential maintenance of community tooling as we enter this critical period of the market cycle. I have tried to balance between large project asks and smaller but still very essential maintenance for existing tooling, with projects that have a proven track record."
