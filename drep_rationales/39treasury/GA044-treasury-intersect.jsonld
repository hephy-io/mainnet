    "comment": "In the first year of its’ existence Intersect has divided opinion with regards to its successes and failures. Admittedly, I too was concerned by the perceived bureaucratic bloat that appeared to be developing in its early stages. With that said, this whole Cardano governance experience has been a learning curve for all involved and charting a course that’s never been taken before was always going to have its challenges.\n\nIt has been encouraging to see the recent course correction and desire for Intersect to be a leaner and more effective co-ordinator and facilitator for the Cardano ecosystem following some recent leadership changes.  I am curious to see how things progress in the event that treasury funding be approved, allowing Intersect to have a chance to truly stand on its own as a community funded ecosystem institution. Additionally, it is unclear how they would accomplish their administrator duties for all of the projects in this current series of treasury withdrawal proposals should they fail to be funded at this time.\n\nAs 1 of 15 proposals in this series of 39 treasury withdrawal governance actions that I had previously voted for during the budget reconciliation process via Ekklesia I vote YES."
