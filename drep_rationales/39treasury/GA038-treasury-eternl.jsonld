    "comment": "I have had a hard time reconciling my vote for this proposal. I am uneasy with treasury funds picking winners and losers in the ecosystem, particularly when Cardano has such a vibrant wallet ecosystem and secondly, that this wallet is not open-source. However, Eternl is probably one of the most used wallets in this ecosystem and has an impressive feature set and history in support of a yes vote.\n\nAs I mentioned in my GovTool rationale, participation on SanchoNet during the development of CIP-1694 and Voltaire was scant. It appeared as though most wallets and projects were content with waiting until governance hit mainnet before putting in the work. Eternl was not one of them, they were there supporting SanchoNet and mostly keeping up with all the various network re-spins as features were developed and implemented. To this day, while most support has left SanchoNet following the completion and implementation of CIP-1694 on mainnet, Eternl still provides support for SanchoNet, allowing participants to discover and experiment with Cardano governance in a safe environment. In fact, Eternl is the only wallet that supports Cardano mainnet, PreProd, Preview and SanchoNet networks.\n\nThe wallet was one of the first implementors of the Keystone hardware wallet, helping them to finally integrate with the Cardano ecosystem having unsuccessfully reached out to another wallet provider a number of years before. The recent v2 upgrade has been largely well received and has a much more appealing UI to newcomers than the previous iteration.\n\nAll in all, while I am apprehensive about deploying treasury funds to a wallet provider I feel as though in this case it has been earned.\n\nWhile not originally one of my selections during the Ekklesia budget reconciliation process, I have decided to vote in favour of funding this proposal at this time."
