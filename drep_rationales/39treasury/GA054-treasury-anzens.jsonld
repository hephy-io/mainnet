    "comment": "As much as I would like to see growth and development in this area, I have to agree with other DReps who have asked the question “if this is a problem so easily solved with this amount of funds, why hasn’t it been done by now?”. It is encouraging to read that the proposers are “also raising external capital from additional investors to sustain operations” and leaves me wondering to what extent treasury funding is actually required here. This is also an area where founding entities such as the Cardano Foundation or Emurgo could easily step in to fill this gap without resorting to applying treasury funding.\n\nCatalyst also has a category for “Cardano Use Cases: Partners & Products” where the maximum ask is 1 million ada. I would be more comfortable voting for this proposal if the proposers were to go that route first and demonstrate with a smaller amount of funds what they are capable of achieving before voting to deploy serious treasury funding in this direction.\n\nWhile not originally one of my selections during the Ekklesia budget reconciliation process, I have decided to not vote in favour of funding this proposal at this time."
