Intersect has already received funding for its main proposal and even after having revised their ask down to 15,750,000 ada, given the rise in the value of ada since the initial budget proposals were submitted, there should still be more than enough there to allow Intersect to execute its role as community facilitator and co-ordinator in order to help the Product Committee achieve its plans as outlined here."
