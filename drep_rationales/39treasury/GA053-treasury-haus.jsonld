    "comment": "This proposal was not originally one of my selections during the Ekklesia budget reconciliation process and I have decided to remain against funding this proposal at this time. It is a large ask for relatively unknown project in the ecosystem and I would consider an application to Cardano Use Cases: Partners and Products a better funding route for a pilot programme before graduating to a treasury withdrawal request of this size. I also attempted to read some of the supporting documentation only to find it sitting behind a request for an email address. Such information should be provided to the community and DReps openly in a publicly accessible format without any such barriers. This is the only proposal that I have come across so far that has linked further information in this manner."
