    "comment": "I support the continued funding for the development of UTxO RPC as it works towards greater blockchain integration for Cardano. I value itâ€™s open-source nature and growing collaborations. Usage across the ecosystem to date includes listed projects such as Lace, Mesh and Amaru.\n\nThis is one of a number of treasury withdrawal requests from TxPipe and I respect that they divided their requests into their respective projects rather than bundling them all into one request, allowing ada holders the opportunity to express their views on what areas they would like to see treasury funds committed to.\n\nAs 1 of 15 proposals in this series of 39 treasury withdrawal governance actions that I had previously voted for during the budget reconciliation process via Ekklesia I vote YES. In keeping with previous voting intentions of keeping total treasury withdrawal expenditure below 250 million ada I have focussed my selections on core development and essential maintenance of community tooling as we enter this critical period of the market cycle. I have tried to balance between large project asks and smaller but still very essential maintenance for existing tooling, with projects that have a proven track record."
