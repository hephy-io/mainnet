    "comment": "While not originally one of my selections during the Ekklesia budget reconciliation process, I have decided to once again to vote against funding this proposal at this time. Project Catalyst has already received a sizeable chunk of treasury funding and the Fund 14 launch materials note that this latest funding round also includes “Generalised Quadratic Voting (GQV) as a proof of concept to the tallying stage. This preserves the existing vote-casting process and will compare traditional linear voting outcomes with quadratic results” (https://projectcatalyst.io/f14launchguide.pdf). While the vendor profile for this proposal is no doubt very well qualified and experienced in the Cardano ecosystem, I feel that we should wait to see the results of the proof-of-concept for this Catalyst fund before re-evaluating the need for an implementation of this proposal."
