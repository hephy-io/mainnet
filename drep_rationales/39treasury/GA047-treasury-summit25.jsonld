    "comment": "I vote in favour of funding the Cardano Summit 2025 and regional tech events. The proposal does provide almost comprehensive global coverage with the flagship event in Europe for the first time in 3 years while North America, South America, Africa and Asia coverage is achieved by proposed 2-day tech events for each region. Regional events each have their own proposed “owner” that each have intimate knowledge of their regions which should hopefully maximise each events impacts and reach.\n\nHaving attended satellite events in 2022 and 2023, followed by the flagship event in 2024 I appreciate the importance that these events play in networking and outreach, both within our own ecosystem and out to the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nWhile not originally one of my selections during the Ekklesia budget reconciliation process, I have decided to vote in favour of funding this proposal at this time."
