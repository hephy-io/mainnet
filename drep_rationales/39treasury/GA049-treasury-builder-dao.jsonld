    "comment": "I have debated between abstain and yes for this proposal for a while. I recognise the need for a funding mechanism that complements Catalyst, that allows more established projects to receive development funding that doesn’t detract from Catalyst’s role as an innovation engine for new and smaller projects. I also appreciate that it could be too much to expect each and every project to seek treasury funding every time that they have a proposal for new products or features. This increases administrative burden on both the developers and DReps/CC.\n\nHowever, I also respect that cryptocurrency is usually about removing/reducing middlemen and this approach also reduces the ability for DReps to have a say in what gets funded. Similar to my rationale for the Paid Open-Source Model proposal though, I feel that this does fill a gap in current funding avenues, allowing developers to focus on building rather than bureaucracy.\n\nWith that said, I will be watching the performance and outputs from this DAO going forward before committing to future funding.\n\nWhile not originally one of my selections during the Ekklesia budget reconciliation process, I have decided to vote in favour of funding this proposal at this time."
