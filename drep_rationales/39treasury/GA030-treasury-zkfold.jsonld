    "comment": "As one of two ZK proposals currently requesting funding from the Cardano treasury I think it is important to have teams exploring a range of scaling solutions for Cardano. While a lot of the zero-knowledge focus has been around Midnight it will be good to see some developments in this area for Cardano itself too. The vendor profile states that the team is making progress towards a tesntet deployment of their ZK Rollup and while some concerns remain over the vagueness of the team description provided, it is hoped that Intersect oversight of all funded projects will hold them accountable to sufficient milestone achievements in order to ensure the team is up to the task if funded.\n\nWhile not originally one of my selections during the Ekklesia budget reconciliation process, I have decided to include this item amongst my funding choices at this time."
