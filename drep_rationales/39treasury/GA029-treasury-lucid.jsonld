    "comment": "I support the treasury withdrawal request to fund the ongoing maintenance and development of Lucid Evolution, one of the most used off-chain libraries in the ecosystem. As I understand it, this is what was once Lucid, developed by Alessandro but now active development has been taken up by Anastasia Labs here with Lucid Evolution in order to ensure the continued maintenance and development of one of the longest standing building blocks for the wider Cardano developer community. As an essential open-source component for Cardano developers I support this treasury withdrawal even though at 130,903 ada it does come close to me considering it better suited for Catalyst funding.\n\nAs 1 of 15 proposals in this series of 39 treasury withdrawal governance actions that I had previously voted for during the budget reconciliation process via Ekklesia I vote YES. In keeping with previous voting intentions of keeping total treasury withdrawal expenditure below 250 million ada I have focussed my selections on core development and essential maintenance of community tooling as we enter this critical period of the market cycle. I have tried to balance between large project asks and smaller but still very essential maintenance for existing tooling, with projects that have a proven track record."
