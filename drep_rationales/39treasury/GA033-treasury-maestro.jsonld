    "comment": "The Maestro team have a proven track record within Cardano and the wider ecosystem of UTxO-based blockchains. I appreciate some of the concerns raised by others regarding overlap across a number of projects also working on Bitcoin integrations, I feel that Cardano as an ecosystem needs to start paying those that have been successfully contributing to this ecosystem for a while now or risk losing that talent altogether. Maestroâ€™s existing support for Fluidtokens, various wallets and other layer 2 solutions demonstrates their existing value to this ecosystem.\n\nWhile not originally one of my selections during the Ekklesia budget reconciliation process, I have decided to include this item amongst my funding choices at this time."
