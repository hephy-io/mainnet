    "comment": "I choose to vote ABSTAIN on this budget info action for Constitutional Committee compensation at this time. Having been one of the few people to have participated in all three arms of Cardano governance (SPO, DRep and ICC) I know the level of work that goes into being a member on the Constitutional Committee and absolutely agree that there should be some level of compensation for the work. Having completed a term on the Interim Constitutional Committee, as one of ten members chosen to fulfil the role of the Intersect seat, I can attest to amount of time and energy that it can take.\n\nIn my opinion, consortiums are the best option for CC seats, they offer greater resilience to outside influence and flexibility when one or more members are unable to be present for one reason or another. With that said, they also come with greater organisational requirements; each member does their own research, meetings have to be co-ordinated to discuss and debate findings, votes have to be taken, rationale documents prepared and votes submitted. All of this work is carried out, usually alongside full-time jobs and other commitments. During my tenure as a team of 8-10 members I can confirm that by the end of the ICC term, I was exhausted. To expect this work to continue uncompensated is unsustainable and I welcome the discussion on this topic that this proposal has brought to the forefront.\n\nDespite these words, I have chosen to vote ABSTAIN at this time due to the lack of clarity around the numbers in the budget info action and the lack of socialisation beforehand. I think that the submission caught the community by surprise and although cost breakdowns have been provided on social channels, I feel that this proposal would have been stronger for having had them included within the text.\n\nIt has been sad to hear of the Cardano Atlantic Council’s plans to retire their seat as a result of the community response to this proposal but I thank them for their services to date and for bringing this topic to the forefront of conversation once again."
