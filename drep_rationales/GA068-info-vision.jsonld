    "comment": "This particular proposal has been submitted by a community member in an attempt to provide input for the Intersect Product Committee. However, Product Committee members have already publicly stated that this is a premature submission and that “PC has not signed off on current verbiage”. (https://x.com/ADAFrog_Pool/status/1971295372908822628) With this in mind I am voting to ABSTAIN at this time so as not to unnecessarily waste time on an incomplete proposal. I respect that this info action was submitted with good intentions but if it was not sanctioned by the Product Committee itself and there will be an official proposal submitted  in the near future, this submission does little else but to take up more valuable DRep and CC members time and would have been better suited for the proposal discussion page on GovTool rather than going straight to on-chain (https://gov.tools/proposal_discussion)."
