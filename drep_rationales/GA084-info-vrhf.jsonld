    "comment": "I vote YES in favour of naming the next Cardano hard fork after Max van Rossem. It has become community tradition to name hard fork events after prominent community contributors, with past hard forks named Vasil, Chang and Plomin.\n\nI was fortunate enough to have briefly met Max in Argentina during the Constitutional Convention, there in his capacity as Delegate for the Dutch Cardano community. It was only after his passing that I learned of his many other contributions, as outlined in this proposal.\n\nAs one of three members who formed Cardano Constitutional Consortium (CCC), Max also ran for election in the first fully community-elected Constitutional Committee elections last year. Unfortunately, CCC placed ninth and just out of the top seven which were elected. As a member of Adara Consortium, who placed eight in that same election, we joined forces with the remaining members of the CCC to once again run in the recent Snap CC Election, this time as Phoenix Alliance. The naming and symbolism we put forth chosen in part as a way to try and honour Max’s legacy in some small way. Our consortium was once again unsuccessful in that election too and so I welcome another opportunity to honour Max’s legacy with a YES vote for this proposal."
