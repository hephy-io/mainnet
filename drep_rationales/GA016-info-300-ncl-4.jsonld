    "comment": "I vote “NO” on the proposal for a 300M ada net change limit (NCL) spanning epochs 563 – 635. At the time of voting, despite being hosted using IPFS, the metadata file for this proposal was inaccessible and I was unable to verify the content hash that was provided at the time of submission. This situation highlights a potential issue regarding immutable storage mediums. While files may appear to have a greater level of immutability about them when hosted using platforms such as IPFS, if the node(s) used for pinning such files become inaccessible over time, so does the content. For this reason, it is important that files be pinned to multiple nodes in order to ensure some level of redundancy."
