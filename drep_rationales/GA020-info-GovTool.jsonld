    "comment": "I vote YES in support of the proposed budget for 12 months full active maintenance and development of GovTool.\n\nAs a cli-based DRep, I have no need for a user-interface like GovTool. If it disappears, I will still be able to check proposals on-chain and vote on-chain as I have done for the past year and a half (including SanchoNet). However, I am able to appreciate the importance of the role it has and can continue to play in Cardano governance, beyond the user-interface that we all see on the website.\n\nGovTool has been there since the beginning, during the days of the Cardano governance testnet “SanchoNet”. While many apps and wallets appeared to wait until governance was on mainnet before putting in the work, GovTool was there building the foundations so that access was made easy for new DReps from day one of mainnet governance and arguably, we wouldn’t have the DRep registration numbers that we have today without it.\n\nWhile new platforms have emerged alongside GovTool, they do not diminish the need for GovTool. The support for Mainnet, PreProd and Preview networks is rare across all governance platforms and allows access for developers and DReps who want to test out governance proposals in a safe environment without putting real world funds at risk. I may be a cli-based DRep who has submitted protocol parameter updates to both SanchoNet and Preview using the cli but without GovTool support for the Preview network, it would have been much harder to get Preview DRep participation and pass the proposal to fix the dRepActivity and govActionLifetime mismatch earlier this year (see https://preview.gov.tools/outcomes/governance_actions/35b81b424956f018bb4a4bb9e160375c1921a3b40b60a1efc539bcd6b5b20159#0).\n\nThe GovTool platform provides increased accessibility to Cardano governance, the main site hosts features like the DRep Directory, Budget Proposals, Governnace Actions (Proposals, Live Actions and Outcomes) as well as hosting documentation for Guides and an FAQs section. Less visible is the constitution sub-domain (https://constitution.gov.tools) that host the Cardano Constitution in an accessible format, Constitutional Committee Members page,  ICC/CC voting updates page and the recent CC election portal. Furthermore, GovTool also provides free and open APIs used by many other tools and service providers in the ecosystem that would struggle if the APIs were to disappear.\n\nIn conclusion, while many may feel that GovTool needs much improvement, it does already provide much value to the ecosystem and the maintenance of open and accessible governance is vital for Cardano while governance is still essentially in its infancy. I vote to fund GovTool for 12 more months after which the community can reassess the state of Cardano governance once it has had chance to mature properly."
