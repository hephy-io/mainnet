    "comment": "I vote YES on the update committee governance action. As with the previous update committee governance action, Intersect helped facilitate an off-chain election via the Ekklesia platform to determine the candidate put forth here. I will continue to praise the Ekklesia platform for its accessibility to CLI and multisig DReps, a standard of login I still hope to one day see across the wider selection of Cardano governance tooling. DReps had time to vote one choice from a selection of five candidates and after a close outcome between the top two most voted candidates, Cardano Curia is the candidate being put forward here.\n\nIt is essential for the continuation of Cardano governance that a new Constitutional Committee member be installed as soon as possible after the retirement of the Cardano Atlantic Council resulted in the Committee falling below the committeeMinSize parameter of 7, as mandated by the ledger. As a competing candidate in this election, I acknowledge the votes of the DReps who participated and vote YES on this proposal.\n\nIn order to avoid a similar scenario in the future I would also support updating the CC with 1-2 more members soon so that the Committee size has a buffer between its’ committeeMinSize and its’ current operating size. I have advocated for this since the Cardano Summit in Berlin last month and will continue to whenever the topic arises. I understand calls to reduce the committeeMinSize in the future but this will take time as the Constitution lists it a parameter “Critical to the Governance System” and has certain time-bound requirements to it before an action can be submitted on-chain. Simply voting in more members is the quickest and easiest solution to this risk right now.\n\nThis is a combined rationale for the required SPO and DRep votes submitted simultaneously in this transaction."
